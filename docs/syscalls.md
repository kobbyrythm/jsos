[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L198)

### readDirectory(`path`, `callback`)

> 
> Reads all entries from a directory. Each entry is represented as an
> object with a `name` property and `type` property.

[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L244)

### close(`fd`)

> 
> Closes an open file
> 

> **fd:** The file descriptor to close

[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L268)

### stat(`path`, `callback`)

> 
> Returns an object with metadata about a file. The object will have
> the properties `size` (the size of the file in bytes), `name` (the
> name of the file), `type` (one of "file" or "directory"), and `path`
> (the absolute path to the file)
> 

> **path:** The absolute path to the file

> **callback:** The function to be called upon completion of the operation.               The callback will be passed two parameters: `error` and `stat`

[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L287)

### env(`name`, `value`)

> 
> Gets or sets an environment variable for the current process
> 

> **name:** The name of the variable to get/set

> **value:** Optional. If omitted, `OS.env` will return the current           value of the environment variable `name`. If set, the           environment variable will be set to this value

[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L320)

### wait(`pid`, `callback`)

> 
> Waits for a process to terminate
> 

> **pid:** The ID of the process to wait on

> **callback:** The function to call when the process identified by               `pid` exits. This function will be passed the exit status               of the process as its only parameter

[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L336)

### exit()

> 
> Terminates the current process. This system call will return, but
> no more callbacks will be scheduled by the system for this process

[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L357)

### dup(`src`, `dest`)

> 
> Duplicates an open file descriptor. This creates an alias for the
> same open file on a different descriptor number.
> 

> **src:** The existing file descriptor to duplicate

> **dest:** Optional. If set, this will be the descriptor number for           alias. This will overwrite any existing file descriptor on           this number. If omitted, a descriptor number will be picked           by the OS.

> **returns:** The descriptor number of the alias

[Source](../kernel/js/kernel/process.js#L370)

### pipe()

> 
> Creates a new bi-directional pipe
>
